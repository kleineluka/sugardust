> Hey, you! Rise and shine! We've got work to do.

This is a huge work in progress, but basically, it will be a mod installer, configuration manager, and launcher for HuniePop 2 ^~^ A proper README will come here when it's done...

In the meantime, if you wanna help out, the stack looks like this: Rust (backend) + Astro+TailwindCSS (frontend) + Tauri V2 (bridge). 🥰

A lot of the code is messy and reusing code from my older mod manager and using dummy data until I hook up the backend properly, so please forgive me! I also am just spamming a lot of generic SVG icons for now until I can find/make better ones. >~<
